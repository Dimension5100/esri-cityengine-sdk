# Esri CityEngine SDK Examples

The Esri CityEngine is based on the procedural runtime, which is the underlying engine that supports two GP tools in ArcGIS 10.x and drives procedural symbology in the release of ArcGIS Professional. The CityEngine SDK enables you as a 3rd party developer to extend CityEngine with additional import and export formats. Moreover, you can integrate the procedural runtime in your own client applications taking full advantage of the procedural core without running CityEngine or ArcGIS.

## Preamble

This document explains how to install the CityEngine SDK and how to work with the source-code examples contained in this repository. The Esri CityEngine SDK is packaged into three parts:
- This git repository with the example sources.
- An archive with the SDK binaries and documentation (whitepaper and API reference).
- An archive with example data (e.g. rule packages and initial shapes).

The archives are available for download at the corresponding github release page. See installation instructions below for details.

## CityEngine SDK Releases
- [v1.3.1888 (2015-03-31, CityEngine 2015.0)](https://github.com/Esri/esri-cityengine-sdk/releases/tag/1.3.1888)
- [v1.2.1591 (2014-09-01, CityEngine 2014.1)](https://github.com/Esri/esri-cityengine-sdk/releases/tag/1.2.1591)
- [v1.1.1471 (2014-05-29, CityEngine 2014.0)](https://github.com/Esri/esri-cityengine-sdk/releases/tag/1.1.1471)
- v1.0.1209 (2014-01-15, CityEngine 2013.1)

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Download the SDK binary archive from the release page
3. Download the SDK example data archive from the release page
4. Unzip the archives into the cloned repository into a "prt" and "data" directory.

The final directory layout should look like this:
```
/esri-cityengine-sdk/
    examples/...
    license/...
    data/...
    prt/
        bin/...
        cmake/...
        doc/...
        include/...
        lib/...
```

## Examples
This repository contains a number of source code examples. Each example contains a README with detailed instructions how to build and use it.

A quick overview:
- prt4cmd: a simple command line utility to apply rule packages onto initial shapes and generate models.
- prt4maya: wraps the SDK into a plugin for Autodesk Maya
- prt4unity: wraps the SDK into a plugin for the Unity game engine
- stlenc: demonstrates how to write a custom encoder, in this case for the STL geometry format.

## General Software Requirements
Please note that the individual example READMEs may include further requirements.

#### All Platforms
* To load custom encoders built with this SDK in CityEngine, at least CityEngine 2014.0 is required.

#### Windows
* Windows XP SP1 or later (32bit and 64bit)
* License for CityEngine 2013 or later
* NMake 10.0 or later (part of Visual Studio)
* CMake 2.8.10 or later (http://www.cmake.org)
* Recommended C++ Compilers for simple clients (prt4cmd example):
    * Microsoft VC 10.0 or later
* To compile SDK extensions (prt4maya example, stlenc example, custom encoders) it is required to use this **exact** C++ compiler version / boost libraries:
    * Microsoft VC10 C++ Compiler (cl.exe) 16.00.40219.01, included in Visual Studio 2010 SP1 
    * boost 1.53 headers and binaries 
        * get the boost 1.53 headers from http://www.boost.org
        * get the boost 1.53 pre-compiled binaries from http://boost.teeks99.com (e.g. boost_1_53_0-vc64-bin.exe or boost_1_53_0-vc32-bin.exe)
        * note: if you compile boost yourself, the boost libraries need to be compiled with correct compiler (VC 10)

    * GCC 4.2.1 or later
    * Clang 3.0 or later
* To compile SDK extensions (prt4maya example, stlenc example, custom encoders) it is required to use this **exact** C++ compiler version / boost libraries:
    * Apple GCC 4.2.1 included in:
        * XCode 4.2 and MacOSX SDK 10.7 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658, LLVM build 2336.1.00)
    * boost 1.53 headers and binaries (e.g. via homebrew or directly from http://www.boost.org)
